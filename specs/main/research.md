# Research & Decisions

This document outlines the research findings and decisions made to resolve the `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` items from the implementation plan.

## 1. Testing Strategy

**Decision**:

A multi-faceted testing approach will be used:
- **Frontend (React/Mantine)**: **Jest** with **React Testing Library (RTL)** for component and unit tests.
- **Backend (Node.js/Electron)**: **Jest** for unit and integration tests of backend logic.
- **End-to-End (E2E)**: **Playwright** for testing the full application flow in the Electron environment.

**Rationale**:

- **Jest and RTL** are the industry standard for testing React applications, providing a robust framework for testing components from a user's perspective.
- **Jest** is a versatile and widely-used testing framework for JavaScript and Node.js, making it a good choice for the backend.
- **Playwright** offers excellent support for testing Electron applications, allowing for reliable E2E tests that simulate user interactions.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Vitest**: A good alternative to Jest, especially for Vite-based projects. However, Jest is more established and has a larger ecosystem.
- **Spectron/TestCafe**: Other E2E testing tools for Electron, but Playwright is gaining popularity and has first-party support from Microsoft.

## 2. Performance Goals

**Decision**:

The following performance goals will be targeted:

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Application Launch Time: < 5 seconds
  - Screen/Form Load Time: < 3 seconds
  - Data Operations (CRUD): < 1 second
  - Search/Filter Operations: < 500ms
- **Resource Utilization**:
  - Memory Usage: < 200MB (idle), < 500MB (peak)
  - CPU Usage: < 5% (idle)

**Rationale**:

These goals are based on common performance benchmarks for desktop CRUD applications and aim to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Stricter performance goals could be set, but these provide a good balance between performance and development effort for the initial prototype.

## 3. Constraints

**Decision**:

The primary constraint is the use of a **file-based database (SQLite or JSON)**. The design will need to mitigate the following risks associated with this choice:

- **Data Integrity**: Implement mechanisms to ensure data consistency, such as atomic write operations and validation schemas.
- **Security**: The application will provide an option to encrypt the database file and protect it with a user-provided password.
- **Concurrency**: While this is a single-user application, file locking mechanisms will be considered to prevent data corruption if multiple instances of the application are accidentally opened.

**Rationale**:

The user has specified a file-based database for portability. Acknowledging the inherent constraints allows for a more robust design that proactively addresses potential issues.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- A more robust database like PostgreSQL or a cloud-based solution would offer better scalability and data integrity, but would not meet the user's requirement for a simple, file-based setup.
